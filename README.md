Scrapy Processors is a collection of Processor classes meant to work with
the [itemloaders](https://pypi.org/project/itemloaders/) package, commonly used with the [scrapy](https://pypi.org/project/Scrapy/) webscraping framework.

These processors are meant to extend / replace the provided processors in the [itemloaders](https://pypi.org/project/itemloaders/) package.

Additionally the provided Processor and ProcessorCollection classes can be extended to create custom processors.


## Installation

To install Scrapy Processors, simply use pip:

```bash
$ pip install scrapy-processors
```
